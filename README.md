This project focuses on predicting the Cost to Company (CTC) using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing key features such as skills, experience, education, and other relevant factors, the model provides an estimated CTC for a candidate.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution, correlations, and key insights.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented multiple algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Lasso and XGBoost to predict CTC.


Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to assess performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models for better accuracy and generalization.

Technologies Used : 
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
Jupyter Notebook
